About the project
I want to build a virtual bookshelf where I can keep track of what I had read and what to read next.  I built a random generator for books regardless of genres and authors to expand my book collection.


Build with
- REACT
- Bootstrap



Installation
1. Get a free API Key @ Google Book API
2. Clone the repo
    > git clone https://github.com/yuanwuu/react-bookshelf.git
3. Install NPM packages
    > npm install
4. Enter your API in /src/pages/Home.js
    > const apiKey = 'ENTER YOUR API'
5. Install bootstrap
